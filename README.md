# cs50

This is the code I have created while progressing through the CS50 class.

All of the Week one assignments have been successfully program except for the credit card problem!
	including : hello, water, both mario problem sets, and greedy


The code used for the "credit" problem is buggy and unfinished. I will go back to the problem later.

Now beginning work on the Week two problems
