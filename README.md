# cs50

This is the code I have created while progressing through the CS50 class, but without using the cs50 IDE or Header.

Problem Set 1: C

	hello complete, 
	water complete,
	mario complete,
	mario (more comfortable) complete,
	greedy complete,
	credit is still buggy will come back to it


Problem Set 2: Crypto

	initials complete,
	caesar complete,
	vigenere complete,
	crack is over my head so I will skip to week 3 and come back to it

Problem Set 3: Game of Fifteen

	I dont have access to the cs50 header so i will need to re-write 
	to code in the files do that they are useable to a non paying cs50
	student before I will be able to complete the assignment.

	Currently re-writing find.c and trying to figure out how to 
	impliment qsort() in place of the cs50 sort() function.

	I will also need to find a suitable replacement for the search
	function.

Problem Set 4: Forensics

	Will begin working on this set after watching the lecture. Hopefully
	the code will not need to be re-written to the same extent as
	Problem Set 3.
