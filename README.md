# cs50

This is the code I have created while progressing through the CS50 class.

All of the Week one assignments have been successfully program except for the credit card problem!
	including : hello, water, both mario problem sets, and greedy


The code used for the "credit" problem is buggy and unfinished. I will go back to the problem later.

Week2

	initials complete,
	caesar still has bugs when key + message > 'z' or 'Z'
	hopefully will have bug fixed by tomorrow
