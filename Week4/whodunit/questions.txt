1.  stdint.h provides type definitions which allow the programmer to
    define exact width integer types and minimum and maximum allowable
    integer values.

2.  this allows the programmer to the be know that the integers they
    are using with be of the specified size in bytes. Without using these 
    integer type definition there is no guarantee that the integers will
    the necessary sizeof 8 bits, 16 bits, or 32 bits.

3.  BYTE is 1 byte (8 bits) DWORD is 4 bytes (32 bits), LONG is 4 bytes 
    (32 bits), and WORD is 2 bytes (16 bits).

4.  The first two bytes of a BMP file define the bfType.
 
5.  bfSize includes the padding when taking the size of the image in bytes
    into account and bisize solely looks at the size of the image without 
    taking padding into account.

6.  A negative biHeight means that the image originates in the lower left 
    coner of the image. A positive biHeight denotes that the image 
    originates in the upperleft corner.

7.  The biBitCount field of BITMANINFOHEADER defines the number of bits 
    each pixel is given and as a result the variety of color the image
    will have.

8.  NULL will be returned if the program is unable to open and read the
    input file or unable to open or write to the output file.

9.  TODO

10. The number of bytes per line must be divisible by 4. If there are 
    only three pixels per line and three bits per pixel then that gives
    us a total of 9 bytes per line. To make the number of bytes per line 
    divisible by 4, three more byte of padding must be added so the total 
    bytes per line will be 12.

11. fseek skips over a specified field when scanning through the input file.
    In the case of copy.c the fseek fuction is skipping over padding as the 
    input file is scanned.

12.  SEEK_CUR is a constant which is used the specify the offset between 
     scanned values in the input file?
